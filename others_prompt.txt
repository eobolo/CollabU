code debugging: coffee management system
================================================
The provided code is part of an Order Management System designed to process orders efficiently and fairly for a coffee shop. The system's intended functionality is to ensure that high-priority orders are always processed first, and within each priority group (high-priority or non-priority), orders must be processed in the sequence they were added, ensuring fairness. However, there is a bug in the process_order function: while the code sorts orders by priority and order_id, it allows non-priority orders to be processed before all high-priority orders are completed, which violates the intended behavior. This means users can bypass the required sequence of order processing. Correct the code to strictly enforce that non-priority orders are only processed after all high-priority orders are completed, and ensure that within each priority group, orders are processed in the order they were added. If a user attempts to process an order out of sequence, the system should display: "Oops! You must process orders in sequence. Please check and try again!" Fix the bug while maintaining the rest of the program's functionality, such as viewing, adding, and saving orders.
