As part of our project management system, I’m tasked with creating a console-based Python program to manage article writing and freelancer payments. The program used an object-oriented approach, where an ArticleManager class is responsible for handling article processing, such as splitting it into pages and calculating payment for the freelancer based on the number of pages. The program also validates the article’s word count to meet minimum requirements for paid pages.

Here are the requirements:

Each page should consist of 20 lines, with each line containing 12 words. Note: the last page may be a partial page (i.e. in the example here, 241 words would be 2 pages)
You can assume that words are separated by one or more whitespace characters
The payment calculation is as follows:
Fewer than 1 page: $0
1-2 pages: $30
3-4 pages: $60
More than 4 pages: $100
The program should display each page in the console, along with the total pages and payment amount at the end.
Here’s my initial implementation:

import re

class ArticleManager:
    def __init__(self, article_text):
        self.article_text = article_text
        self.pages = []
        self.paid_pages = 0
        self.words = 0
  
    def split_into_pages(self):
        words_per_line = 12
        lines_per_page = 20

        self.words = re.split(r'\s+', self.article_text.strip())
        # print(len(self.words))

        lines = []
        for i in range(0, len(lines), words_per_line):
            lines.append(' '.join(self.words[i:i + words_per_line]))

        self.pages = []
        for i in range(0, len(lines), lines_per_page):
            self.pages.append('\n'.join(lines[i:i + lines_per_page]))
  
    def calculate_payment(self):
        self.paid_pages = len(self.words) // 240
        if self.paid_pages < 1:
            return 0
        elif 2 <= self.paid_pages <= 4:
            return 50
        else:
            return 100

    def display_pages(self):
        payment = self.calculate_payment();
        print(f"Total Pages: {len(self.pages)}")
        print(f"Paid Pages: {self.paid_pages or 0}")
        print(f"Payment Due: ${payment}")
        
        for index, page in enumerate(self.pages):
            print(f"\nPage {index + 1}:\n{page}\n")

    def process_article(self):
        self.split_into_pages()
        self.display_pages()
  
# Example usage
article_text = "Replace with actual article text"  # Replace with actual article text
article_manager = ArticleManager(article_text)
article_manager.process_article()


However, I have several concerns about the current implementation:

The program may not handle very large articles efficiently due to the current structure.
There is minimal error handling, and certain cases (such as non-string input) may cause unexpected issues. In the case of invalid input, I'd like to raise an exception.
The payment logic is hardcoded, making it difficult to update if the payment structure changes in the future.
The program doesn’t include logging or debugging statements for identifying issues with page and line processing, which may complicate testing.
Could you help review the code and suggest improvements to address these concerns? Please advise on ways to optimize the program for larger articles, improve error handling, and make the payment calculation more flexible.

Please note to include instructions for setting up the testing environment. Also make sure to use the current interface (except for the constructor, which should take in article text and an options object (with keys words_per_line, lines_per_page, and payment_structure) in that order)

Changes made to the code:

Added error handling to ensure that the article text is a string.
Made the payment structure more flexible by using an object to store the payment amounts for different numbers of pages.
Improved the efficiency of the code by using a more efficient algorithm to split the article into pages.
Added logging statements to help with debugging.
Made the code more modular by breaking it up into smaller functions.
Added a processArticle method to encapsulate the entire process of processing the article.
Optimizations for larger articles:

The code now uses a more efficient algorithm to split the article into pages, which should improve performance for larger articles.
The code now uses a streaming approach to process the article, which should reduce memory usage and improve performance for larger articles.
Error handling:

The code now checks to ensure that the article text is a string, and throws an error if it is not.
The code now handles the case where the payment structure does not contain a payment amount for the total number of pages.
Payment calculation:

The payment calculation is now more flexible, using an object to store the payment amounts for different numbers of pages.
The payment calculation now uses a default payment amount if no payment amount is found for the total number of pages.
