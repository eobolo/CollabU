However, even though it's already been twelve months since the powerful monsters' first sightings, the resilient Abbott family still stands strong.

It is the first human-made object ever to do so. Slowly dying within its heart is a plutonium generator that will beat for perhaps another decade before the lights on Voyager finally go out. But this little craft will travel on for millions of years, carrying a Golden Record bearing recordings and images of life on Earth. In all likelihood Voyager will outlive humanity and all our creations. It could be the only thing to mark our existence. Perhaps some day an alien will find it and wonder. The story of Voyager is an epic of human achievement, personal drama and almost miraculous success. Launched 16 days apart in Autumn 1977, the twin Voyager space probes have defied all the odds, survived countless near misses and almost 40 years later continue to beam revolutionary information across unimaginable distances. With less computing power than a modern hearing aid, they have unlocked the stunning secrets of our Solar System on a journey as revolutionary as the first circumnavigation of the globe and humankind's first footprint on the moon. In this powerful, poetic and cinematic feature documentary, THE FARTHEST celebrates these magnificent machines, the men and women who built them and the vision that propelled them farther than anyone could ever have hoped. Launched from a fractious planet, these pioneers sail on serenely in the darkness - an enduring testament to the ingenuity of humankind and the untapped limits of the human imagination. Passionate organic storytelling with people, images, archive and opinion woven with daring and brio makes THE FARTHEST a genuinely cinema-scale adventure.—avoid sexist language",

                        "summary": "\"Watch Out, We're Mad\" begins by narrating that classic story in a display of comic art. In the story, two friends enter a car race to win a dune buggy. But the problem arises when it becomes impossible to share the dune buggy. So the competition began between the friends to eat sausages and beer. But before the result, a goon came and set fire to their red dune buggy. In a fit of rage, the two friends get mad and beat the goon off, forcing their leader to buy dune buggies for each of them. But eventually, one of them caught fire again, leaving another dune buggy on which the two friends continued to fight.The scene shifts to another story where those two friends' sons, Carezza (Edoardo Pesce) and Sorriso (Alessandro Roja), playfully run away with the red dune buggy of their fathers, but are blocked by a group of bad guys who offer to gamble. Despite Carezza's disapproval, Sorriso agrees but ultimately loses. As a result, the bad boys escape with the dune buggy as per the terms of the gamble. This time the time-line shifts to the present, where Carezza and Sorriso have grown up. Carezza lives with his dog, Geremia. He is a mechanic.At a circus, we are introduced to a female ringmaster named Miriam (Alessandra Mastronardi). But immediately, a group of goons named Cobras, who belong to a notorious businessman named Torsillo (Christian De Sica), arrive at the circus (where Carezza was fixing Miriam's car). But Carezza isn't afraid of them, as even with a strong slap of his hand, Scajone (Massimiliano Rossi), the leader of the Cobras, fails to turn Carezza's head. Torsillo has his eye on Miriam's circus grounds, where he wants to establish his Torsillo Tower, but Miriam is a tough player to give it to him. While at Miriam's Carezza had seen the flier for a local race that had a dune buggy as the first prize. Carezza leaves the circus grounds.\nThen comes the grown-up Sorriso, who is still angry about the disappearance of the old dune buggy and has seen the same flier for the race as Carezza. Sorriso approaches Carezza at his garage. But Carezza refuses to work with Sorriso. They want to settle the case again by naming them in the competition like their predecessors. Torsillo's son, Raniero (Francesco Bruni), who lacks diplomatic intelligence and common sense like his father, is named in the competition as well. Unfortunately, he doesn't even reach the halfway point of the race due to his own failure. On the contrary, Carezza and Sorriso repeat history by reaching the dune buggy together. So both are declared winners.The decision of who will be the owner of the dune buggy is still a doubtful decision to them, so they try to pick the actual winner of the dune buggy through the old-fashioned beer and sausage competition, but the Cobras steal their dune buggy (on behalf of Torsillo and Raniero) while Carezza and Sorriso are busy shoving their mouths with sausages. Miriam arrives at the tavern and wants Carezza to help her defend the circus, but Carezza is not interested.\nSorriso tries his best to form a love angle with Miriam, but she is not interested. Carezzo and Sorriso suspect Miriam for stealing their dune buggy. but after a lot of heckling (Including a slapping contest with Miriam's cousin Armandino (Michael Schermi)), Miriam tells him that their dune buggy is with Torsillo, but as a cost of that, she demands that when Sorriso approaches Torsillo, he will have to threaten him to take his eyes off the circus grounds. Carezza and Sorriso muster their courage to reach Torsillo and threaten him to return their dune buggy, but not having planned, they can't tell if they can do any harm to Torsillo. Torsillo promises to return the buggy by the next day, if they leave the meeting with his investors. On his return, Sorriso pulls up the model of Torsillo Tower & takes it away with him, saying that Torsillo has to get his eyes off the land of the circus. Torsillo thinks he can answer it differently.Torsillo arrives at Carezza's place to prank them with a small toy model of the dune buggy. Carezza and Sorriso knew they wouldn't get their car back so easily, so after Torsillo's departure, they beat the Cobra gang, breaking all the bones in their bodies. Raniero wants to return the buggy to the guys, but Torsillo tells Raniero to be mean and never blink in a fight. Raniero is not convinced but decides to be mean, to impress his father.\nWhile Carezza and Sorriso are watching Miriam's circus performance, Torsillo's son Raniero arrives with the dune buggy. When Carezza comes running in joy to see his car, Raniero sets fire to the yellow roof of the dune buggy, causing the entire circus to burn. Carezza rescues his dog Geremia, and Sorriso runs to save Miriam. But Miriam learns from her brother that their circus tiger has escaped. Together, Miriam Sorriso and Carezza plan to make Torsillo's end.The next day, when Torsillo throws a party with his business clients, Carezza walks in as a musician and catches Scajone's eye. while Torsillo's enlarged and more powerful Cobra gang attacks them, Carezza and Sorriso, along with the circus men, beat the gangsters of the Cobra gang and make their situation worse. When Miriam finally blocks Torsillo's way after a violent riot, he points a gun at Miriam. But she survives when her escaped circus tiger pounces on Torsillo. Carezza and Sorriso get their dune buggies back. But the fight for rights over it continues, so Sorriso and Cariza go back to the restaurant for a beer and sausage competition. But while they are both busy eating, Miriam escapes with the dune buggy again.We also saw before Miriam came to disrupt Carezza and Sorriso's sausage competition, right before their dune buggy was stolen in the first place. However, it is quite possible that Miriam stole the dune buggy and left it near Torsillo so that Sorriso and Carezza take their revenge and Miriam gets her land back. It could be a possibility that Miriam is sketching a new plan, but what is that? However, \"Watch Out, We're Mad\" ends here with her plan remaining a secret.",

If the three emerge from their sailing trip alive, they may be forever changed by their encounter.—Huggo",
                        "synopsis": "Well off Andrzej and Krystyna's marriage is at a stage where familiarity breeds contempt, that contempt which is outwardly shown only behind closed doors and only when an incident of some sort sets off one or the other. While driving through the countryside on a Sunday on their way to the lake to embark on an overnight sailing excursion, they almost run over a young male hitchhiker. Despite the antagonism between Andrzej and the hitchhiker, Andrzej offers him a ride as far as the marina. By the time they reach the lake, their antagonism has dissipated enough that Andrzej asks if he would like to join them on their sailing trip. The hitchhiker accepts despite knowing nothing about sailing. As the sailing trip progresses, the antagonism between the two men begins to increase again, fueled on both sides as each strives to be the alpha male. Andrzej needs to show his superiority, while the hitchhiker needs to show that his young age and inexperience, not only with sailing but with life in general, do not make him any less of a man in comparison. Later incidents demonstrate that their relationship may have been different if Krystyna was not in the picture. The hitchhiker's pocket knife, seemingly his most prized possession on his person, becomes a symbol of that power struggle between the two men. If the three emerge from their sailing trip alive, they may be forever changed by their encounter.—Huggo",

                        "summary": "Twenty-four hours in a Rome decimated by fires and blackouts.Manuel, a 16 years old boy, one evening infiltrates a homosexual orgiastic party where alcohol and drugs are in circulation in considerable quantities. His task is to immortalize a minister present there as soon as he is guilty of exploitation of child prostitution. While filming his target, however, he realizes that the building has some hidden cameras and, shocked by the idea that shortly before he had been filmed while snorting cocaine, runs away.The person who forced him to fulfill this task is Vasco, a corrupt policeman whose audiovisual material was commissioned by some high-ranking people in exchange for a large sum of money. Faced with the young man's escape, he flies into a rage and begins to hunt him down. Manuel takes refuge with Polniuman, an old friend of his father Daytona and, like the latter, a former member of the Magliana gang. The man, now blind, agrees to help the boy and sends him to another old acquaintance of Roman crime, Romeo known as Cammello, recently released from prison because he is terminally ill. The latter, however, chases Manuel away, preferring to enjoy his last days of life with his wife.Thanks to the GPS signal from Manuel's cell phone that Polniuman kept with him, Vasco tracks down the gangster's home and instead of listening to his proposals for a deal, attacks him. The two end up shooting each other, and Polniuman gets the worst of it and is seriously injured. Reached by his trusty Bruno, Vasco finally smothers to death the criminal.The next day Cammello, faced with Manuel's insistence, finds him a temporary bed on his terrace, then meets up with Daytona, now consumed by senile dementia: the two have not spoken to each other for years since the old man had sent his now former friend to carry out a heist which ended with the death of Cammello's son and the man's sentence to twelve years in prison and a criminal asylum. Daytona, until now unaware of everything because Manuel didn't want to worry him, in a rush of clarity confronts Vasco and Bruno, telling them to forget everything; these, in response, kidnap him and, not getting collaboration from a man mostly dedicated to reasoning without reason, kill him. Then, having consulted the files that linked the old man to Cammello, they go to the latter's apartment while he is not there and place a transceiver under the table.Manuel tries to go to his house but, finding that it is monitored by some of Vasco's colleagues, he returns to Cammello who opts to accompany the young man to take a train to leave the city. During the journey the boy reveals that Vasco, shortly before, had photographed him while performing fellatio on an adult in exchange for money: that's how Vasco was able to blackmail him in order to do that task in the party, obtaining less material than requested but still finally delivering to his clients. Although Vasco has settled this matter, Manuel still remains a witness and therefore must be eliminated.Cammello then returns home and only after explaining to his wife where he took Manuel he discover the transceiver, so arrives at the Tiburtina station, in total chaos as many trains have been stopped due to several fires. There he finds Vasco and Bruno who are looking for the boy. The two cops engage in a shootout with Cammello, who dies together with Bruno. Vasco, shot to death in the neck, tries to chase Manuel but dies shortly after.At the police station, while on television they say that the politician he filmed at the orgy has resigned due to a scandal, Manuel meets one of Vasco's sons and gives him his headphones; the young man thanks.Outside, the blackouts and fires continue.In the first part of the closing credits, Polniuman, Cammello and Daytona are remembered with two photos of their golden era interspersed with some short scenes that illustrate the sad end of their corpses: the first two are taken to the morgue, while Daytona is instead crushed by a junkyard together with the car in which he has been locked.",

Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.—Warner Bros. Pictures",
