### Solution Reasoning Prompt  

You are provided with a Node.js script that extracts specific types of data (IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP methods, status codes, or response sizes) from a log file using regular expressions. The program supports two modes: **command-line mode**, where the user passes the file path and extraction type as arguments, and **interactive mode**, where the program prompts the user for input step by step. Once data is extracted, the user can choose to **view** it in the console or **save** it to a file.  

Analyze the correctness and robustness of the script's implementation. Consider whether the regular expressions accurately match the intended patterns (e.g., does the IP address regex handle edge cases?). Evaluate how the program handles invalid inputs, such as missing or empty files, unsupported data types, or unexpected user responses during interactive mode. Test both modes of execution and verify whether the program gracefully handles errors, like unreadable files or empty extraction results.  

To test the script, simulate various log files containing diverse patterns, including edge cases such as incomplete log entries, missing delimiters, and malformed data. Verify the accuracy of both "view" and "save" operations, ensuring that saved files contain the expected content. Finally, identify any areas where the program might fail or behave unpredictably under unusual conditions.
